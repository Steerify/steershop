# Plan: Tutorial Collections, Product Video Upload, Business Plan Visibility, and Plan Features Update

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

All items have been implemented:

1. **✅ Tutorial Collections** - Created `tutorial_collections` table, added `collection_id` and `social_links` to `courses`. Rebuilt admin, entrepreneur, and customer tutorial views with collection-based video grids and social CTAs (YouTube/Instagram/TikTok follow buttons).

2. **✅ Product Video Indicators** - Added play icon overlay on product cards when a `video_url` exists (Products.tsx). Storefront already auto-plays videos.

3. **✅ Business Plan SEO** - Enhanced JSON-LD to use `@type: Store` for Business plans, added `hasOfferCatalog` with `ItemList` schema, brand info, and contact points for richer search engine visibility.

4. **✅ Plan Features Updated** - Database updated with comprehensive, accurate feature lists for Basic (7 features), Pro (8 features), and Business (10 features) plans.
